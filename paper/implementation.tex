\section*{Possible Implementation}
Based on the principles presented during this report we can also present an implementation of this kind of work. There is a research paper called \emph{Simulation, Verification and Automated Composition of Web Services} from Srini Narayanan and Sheila A. McIlraith that provides an actual implementation of what we presented using the same languages and tools.

More specifically, they utilize a DAML-S interpreter that is able to translate the DAML-S markup into a simulation and modeling environment called KarmaSIM. The KarmaSIM allows the interactive simulation and also supports the various verification and performance analysis techniques that were presented earlier.
