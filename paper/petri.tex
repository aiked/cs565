\section*{Semantics}
After describing the necessary semantics to the relevant subset of the DAML-S we can talk more about the actual running of web services. We are using this representation in order to provide to special-purpose machines for task we want to execute. More to the point, we use Petri Nets. Petri Nets are a distributed operational semantics of processes. There are other options available but only Petri Nets is capable of performing quantitative analysis. The usage of Petri Nets also provides the ability to perform computational semantics, it is easy to implement and can address offline tasks such as Web service composition and online execution tasks such as deadlock determination resource satisfaction, and quantitative performance analysis.

There are tradeoffs by using Petri Nets. We have to consider their natural representation of change and and concurrency, it gives us the ability to construct a distributed and executable operational semantics of Web services.
Also, much research has been done that offers the advantage of a lengthy literature that can support the usage of Petri Nets in cases like this. Finally we have to consider the ability of Petri Nets to deal with resources, something that is very important in real web services.

\section*{Petri Nets}
Since we have constructed a situation calculus theory using the DAML-S we can use these models and utilize the Petri Nets to perform our tasks, simulation, evaluation and automatic composition. Before continuing in order to define the basic principles that define Petri Nets let us give a short introduction.

\subsection*{Introduction}
A Petri Net is a bipartite graph containing places (drawn as circles) and transitions (drawn as rectangles). Places hold tokens and represent predicates about the world state or internal state. Transitions are the active component. When all of the places pointing into a transition contain an adequate number of tokens (usually 1) the transition is enabled and may fire, removing its input tokens and depositing a new set of tokens in its output places.

The important features of Petri Nets is the ability to model events and states in a distributed environment. To improve the usage of the system we have includes formalisms like typed arcs, hierarchical control, durative transitions, parameterization, typed (individual) tokens and stochasticity.

\subsection*{Mapping}
This part describes our automatic model construction, simulation and analysis of DAML-S markups using the theory of Petri Nets.

\textbf{} A Petri Net (PN) is an algebraic structure (P, T, I, O) composed of:
\begin{itemize}
\item finite set of places, P = {p1, p2, ... pn}
\item finite set of transitions, T = {t1, t2, ... tm}
\item Transition Input Function, I. I maps each transition ti to
a multiset of P
\item Transition Output Function, O. O maps each transition ti
to a multiset of P
\end{itemize}

    \item[Definition 1 (Petri Nets)]
    A Petri Net (PN) is an algebraic structure (P, T, I, O) composed of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item finite set of places, P = {p1, p2, ... pn}
            \item finite set of transitions, T = {t1, t2, ... tm}
            \item Transition Input Function, I. I maps each transition ti to
            a multiset of P
            \item Transition Output Function, O. O maps each transition ti
            to a multiset of P
        \end{itemize}
    \item[Definition 2 (Markings/Tokens/Initial marking)]
    A marking in a Petri Net PN(P, T, I, O) is a function $\mu$, that maps every place into a natural number.
    \item[Definition 3 (Enabled/Fireable transitions at marking $\mu$)]
    At a given marking $\mu$, if for any ti $\epsilon$ T, $\mu$(p) $\ge$ \#[p,I(ti)], $\forall$ p $\epsilon$ P, then ti is said to be enabled by the marking $\mu$.
    \item[Definition 4 (Transition firing/Occurrence sequence)] The firing of any enabled transition, ti, at marking $\mu$, causes the change of the marking $\mu$ to a new marking $\mu$' as follows: $\forall$ p $\epsilon$ P, $\mu$'(p) = $\mu$(p) - \#[p, I(ti)] + \#[p, O(ti)]. Where: \#[p, I(ti)] and \#[p, O(ti)], denotes, the number of occurrences of place p in the multiset I(ti) and in the multiset O(ti) respectively. A sequence of firings (t1 ...tn) that take an initial marking $\mu$0 to a new marking Î¼N is called an occurrence sequence.
    \item[Graphical representation] The algebraic structure of a Petri Net PN(P, T, I, O) may be represented graphically. In this graphical representation, a Petri Net will be represented by a bipartite graph, where: every place will be represented by a circle; every transition will be represented by a rectangle ; the function I will be represented by directed arcs linking every p $\in$ I(ti) to the transition ti. These arcs are called input arcs to the transition ti; and the function O will be represented by directed arcs linking each transition ti to every p $\in$ O(ti). Analogously with the input arcs, these arcs are called output arcs to the transition ti.

Following we provide some examples on how several types of Distributed OPErational (DOPE) Semantics for the DAML-S Composite Process Constructs would look based on their functionality.

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Sequence} has a list of components that are sub-processes that specify the body. The semantics of the sequence is the execution of several sub-processes with a predefined way. We assume that all the preconditions are satisfied by the execution of each sub-process such as Process 1 and Process 2 so we can finally end the sequence.

    \label{fig:Conditional effects and outputs}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Split Construct} A split composite process is consisted by several sub-processes that are being run concurrently. It simulates the usage of threads in a computer system. For the reasons of this simulation models we do not assume any other standards about how the actual processes are executed. There are any more specifications about waiting times, actual synchronization between the sub-processes due to limitation by this specific model of DAML-S. In order to solve this problem we create new constructs to facilitate the synchronization aspects. The Figure below shows how the two sub-processes work. When both processes are finished a transition fires and we are ready to end the Split(P1, P2) process.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{seq-split.eps}
    \caption{The Split construct}
    \label{fig:Conditional effects and outputs}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Split and Join Construct} A Split and Join composite process consists of a number of processes being executed concurrently. This requires a state like a Synchronize in order for all the processes to finalize and be ready to end. This means that there is partial synchronization between the processes but the composite process can end only if all the sub-processes have been done. Regardless, this enables an optimization of sub-processes running together if they are not depended in each other. This can been shown from the below figure, the Process 1 and 2 are being executed when they are able. After the finalization of execution of both processes we arrive at a state of Synchronization that enables us to finish the process.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{seq-split-join.eps}
    \caption{The Split and Join construct}
    \label{fig:Conditional effects and outputs}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Choice Construct} A Choice composite processes consists of a number of sub-processes. When the time of execution comes a decision is taken and the process chooses a sub-process to execute. The chosen sub-process takes as a parameter a choice bag and is obligated to return another chosen bag. The cardinality of the bag can be expressed by the restriction of Choose(n) where n is (0 $<$ n $<$ $|bag|$). DAML-S is limited in this way and is not able to separate each choice from the other alternatives from the bag of choices. As shown in the figure below Process 1 and 2 are both in the bag of choices. The DAML-S specification corresponds to both as both are being viable and valid possible choices. The selection and the execution of one of the sub-processes allows the model to transition to a state of Done(Choose) regardless the actual choices. This allows the finish of the choice construct composite process.
